Features:

Run a caller through a static voice script that you can easily change using text to speech.

Play DTMF when their their intro bots say 'Press x' to .... - they will then assume you are a humannz and worth calling!

Add in clever logic, at the mo, on the throw of a dice this will echo back their last sentence from them, in your voice (-;)

dos2unix
python3-pip
mpg123

2. sudo pip3 install that:

sudo pip3 install
pyst2
google-cloud-texttospeech
google-cloud-speech
google-cloud-storage

3. Place your google cloud speech api 'credentials.json' file in the location indicted by <ConfigFiles/your-config-file>.

4. Set your external IP address in <ConfigFiles/your-config-file>, (am assuming some sort of NAT in the way)
 	
   Can get with "What is my IP address" sites or 'dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com' 

5. Check if needed that your firewall allows inbound sip paramaters as in <ConfigFiles/your-config-file> : is 5060 UDP by default

6. run 'sudo python3 configure.py [ConfigFiles/your-config-file]'

7. run 'cd Asterisk/deploy;sudo bash ./deploy.sh'

8. To log SIP for wireshark analysis : 'sudo nohup tshark -l -i eth0 -f "udp port 5060" -w sip.pcap &'
